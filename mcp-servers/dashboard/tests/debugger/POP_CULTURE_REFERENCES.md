## Adding New References

When adding new features, consider:
1. Does it fit the 80s-2000s movie theme?
2. Is it recognizable and fun?
3. Does it make sense in context?
4. Can we use it consistently?

## Theme Consistency

All references should:
- Be from movies (not TV shows, games, etc.)
- Be from 1980s, 1990s, or early 2000s
- Be recognizable to developers
- Add personality without being distracting
- Make technical sense in context
