# Pyrite

> "Fool's gold" — shiny, promising, experimental.

## What is this?

Pyrite is a cross-repository workspace for AI-assisted development across the full `/Users/ctavolazzi/Code` codebase. It's where exploratory, integrative, and experimental work happens.

## Philosophy

- **Cross-cutting**: Work that touches multiple repos lives here
- **Experimental**: Not everything will pan out — that's the point
- **Iterative**: Start rough, refine what works
- **Documented**: Track what we try, what works, what doesn't

## Structure

```

├── README.md           # This file
├── _work_efforts/      # Johnny Decimal task tracking
├── experiments/        # Exploratory code and prototypes
├── integrations/       # Cross-repo integration work
└── docs/               # Plans, decisions, learnings
```

## Related Repos

This workspace integrates with:
- `cursor-coding-protocols` — versioning and tooling
- `awesome-pocketbase` — PocketBase infrastructure
- `public-apis` — API adapters (arXiv, etc.)
- Others as needed

## Convention

- Prefix with `_` to sort to top of directory listing
- Use `_work_efforts/` for task tracking (Johnny Decimal)
- Document decisions in `docs/`
- Keep experiments isolated in `experiments/`
