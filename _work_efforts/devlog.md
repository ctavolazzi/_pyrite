# Pyrite Devlog

## 2025-12-20

### 19:45 - Project Initialized
- Created `_pyrite/` directory in `/Users/ctavolazzi/Code/`
- Set up Johnny Decimal work efforts structure
- Created README with project philosophy
- Directory structure:
  - `_work_efforts/` — task tracking
  - `experiments/` — exploratory code
  - `integrations/` — cross-repo work
  - `docs/` — plans and decisions

**Purpose:** Cross-repository workspace for AI-assisted development across the full codebase.

**Name origin:** "Fool's gold" — shiny, promising, experimental. Not everything will pan out, and that's okay.
