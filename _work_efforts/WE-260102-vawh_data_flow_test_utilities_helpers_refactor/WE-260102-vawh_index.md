# WE-260102-vawh: Data Flow Test Utilities & Helpers Refactor

## Metadata
- **Created**: Friday, January 2, 2026 at 8:56:20 PM PST
- **Author**: ctavolazzi
- **Repository**: unknown
- **Branch**: feature/WE-260102-vawh-data_flow_test_utilities_helpers_refactor

## Objective
Refactor and consolidate test utilities used across the data flow test suite. Currently, test fixtures, mocks, and helper functions are duplicated or scattered across test files. This work effort would create a shared test utilities module with reusable fixtures, mock factories, and helper functions to reduce duplication and improve test maintainability.
