# WE-251231-tbsw: Mission Control Live AI Command Center Redesign

## Metadata
- **Created**: Wednesday, December 31, 2025 at 8:48:40 PM PST
- **Author**: ctavolazzi
- **Repository**: _pyrite
- **Branch**: feature/WE-251231-tbsw-mission_control_live_ai_command_center_redesign

## Objective
Transform the work effort detail view from a static project dashboard into a live AI command center with: (1) Live Activity Feed for real-time AI output streaming, (2) Chat/Command Interface for conversational task management, (3) Work Queue showing in-progress/next/completed tasks, (4) Bidirectional context sharing between user and AI. Target: Less Jira, more NASA Mission Control + Discord hybrid.
